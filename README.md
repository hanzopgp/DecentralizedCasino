# Decentralized Casino

## Presentation 

>This is a decentralized application (dapp) built on ethereum blockchain using smart contract and solidity language. After doing [cryptozombies](https://cryptozombies.io) tutorial, watching the [source code](https://github.com/hanzopgp/CryptoZombies) and taking [notes](https://github.com/hanzopgp/CryptoZombies), we are building our first dapp. The goal is to build a casino (dice game, crash game...) on the blockchain, the source code will be public so the users can see if the games are rigged. Thanks to the blockchain technology, the source code won't ever be able to change once the contracts are deployed. This means there will be no way to scam our users. The final goal is to make that app fully secured (paiments, exploits...) and optimised (so the gas fees won't be too expensive).

## How to use

>For testing purposes, we are using truffle/ganache/nodejs to deploy our smart contracts on a local blockchain, with test accounts.
Most of the commands used can be found in MEMO.txt file.

## ToDo features

- Backend casino
- Frontend (js/python/java?)
- Gas optimisation (external, view, memory...)
- Security (SafeMath, Ownable...)
